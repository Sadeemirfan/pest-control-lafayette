        <!-- Bed Bug Identification -->
        <section class="section" style="padding-top: 0;">
          <h2>What Are Bed Bugs?</h2>
          <p>Bed bugs (<em>Cimex lectularius</em>) are small, reddish-brown, parasitic insects that feed exclusively on the blood of warm-blooded hosts &mdash; most often humans. Adult bed bugs are roughly the size and shape of an apple seed, measuring about 4 to 5 millimeters in length. They are flat when unfed, which allows them to hide in extremely tight spaces such as mattress seams, box spring folds, headboard crevices, picture frame edges, and even behind loose wallpaper. After feeding, they swell and become a darker reddish color.</p>
          <p>Bed bugs are not a sign of poor hygiene or a dirty home. They are exceptional hitchhikers that travel in luggage, used furniture, clothing, and even library books. Hotels, college dormitories, hospitals, and public transportation are all common sources of bed bug exposure. Once introduced into a home or business, they spread rapidly and can establish large colonies in a matter of weeks. In Lafayette and across Acadiana, we see bed bug cases in all types of residences &mdash; from apartments to single-family homes to commercial lodging facilities.</p>
          <p>Identifying a bed bug correctly is important before beginning treatment. Nymphs (juvenile bed bugs) are much smaller than adults and nearly translucent, making them harder to spot. Bed bug eggs are tiny, pearl-white, and are often found in clusters. All life stages must be addressed for a treatment to be effective, which is why professional intervention is strongly recommended over DIY approaches.</p>

        <!-- Signs of Infestation -->
        <section class="section">
          <h2>Signs of a Bed Bug Infestation</h2>
          <p>Because bed bugs are small and primarily active at night, many infestations go undetected for weeks or even months. By the time homeowners realize they have a problem, colonies can be well established in multiple locations throughout the bedroom or even in adjacent rooms. Knowing what to look for is the first step toward getting help quickly.</p>
          <p>The most common and immediate sign of bed bugs is waking up with small, red, itchy bite marks &mdash; often arranged in a line or cluster on exposed skin such as arms, shoulders, neck, and legs. However, not everyone reacts to bed bug bites, so the absence of bite marks does not guarantee the absence of bed bugs. Other physical signs are often more reliable indicators of an infestation.</p>

          <h3>Common Warning Signs</h3>
          <ul class="service-list" style="line-height:2; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
            <li><strong>Blood stains on sheets or pillowcases:</strong> Small rust-colored spots caused by bed bugs being crushed after feeding, or from bites that continue to bleed slightly overnight.</li>
            <li><strong>Dark or rusty spots on mattresses and bedding:</strong> These are bed bug excrement stains, which may also appear on walls, furniture, or nearby clothing.</li>
            <li><strong>Live or dead bed bugs:</strong> Check the seams and tags of mattresses, along the edges of box springs, and inside the joints of bed frames and headboards.</li>
            <li><strong>Shed skins (exoskeletons):</strong> Bed bugs molt five times before reaching adulthood. Finding pale, empty shell casings near hiding spots is a reliable sign of an active population.</li>
            <li><strong>Musty, sweet odor:</strong> A significant bed bug infestation can produce a noticeable, unpleasant odor that has been described as sweet and musty, similar to overripe raspberries or coriander.</li>
            <li><strong>Tiny white eggs:</strong> Found in clusters, cemented to fabric or wood surfaces in secluded locations near the bed.</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">If you have observed any of these signs, we strongly recommend scheduling a professional inspection immediately. Bed bug populations double approximately every 16 days under ideal conditions, meaning a small problem can become a severe infestation very quickly.

        <!-- Treatment Methods -->
        <section class="section">
          <h2>Our Bed Bug Treatment Methods</h2>
          <p>Acadiana Pest Solutions uses a multi-faceted approach to bed bug elimination. There is no single treatment that works perfectly in every situation, which is why our certified technicians conduct a thorough inspection first and then recommend the best combination of methods based on the severity of the infestation, the layout of the property, and the needs of the occupants. Our goal is always complete elimination &mdash; not just temporary suppression.</p>

          <!-- Heat Treatment -->
          <div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #c0392b; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Heat Treatment &mdash; The Gold Standard</h3>
            <p>Thermal heat treatment is widely regarded as the most effective single-day solution for bed bug elimination. Our technicians use specialized commercial heating equipment to raise the temperature inside the treated area to between 120 and 135 degrees Fahrenheit &mdash; lethal temperatures for bed bugs at every life stage, including eggs. Unlike chemical treatments, heat penetrates deep into mattresses, furniture, walls, and other hiding spots that are difficult or impossible to treat with sprays or dust.</p>
            <p>The process typically takes 6 to 8 hours, during which our technicians continuously monitor temperatures in multiple locations throughout the room using calibrated sensors. We move furniture and redistribute heat to ensure that no cold spots are missed. Fans and heating units are strategically placed to create a uniform lethal environment throughout the entire treated space.</p>
            <p>Heat treatment is chemical-free, making it an excellent option for homes with young children, pets, or individuals with chemical sensitivities. There is no residual odor, and in most cases, you can return home the same evening. One heat treatment session eliminates all life stages simultaneously &mdash; adults, nymphs, and eggs &mdash; without requiring multiple return visits for a successful outcome.</p>
            <ul style="line-height:2; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
              <li>Kills all life stages including eggs in a single treatment</li>
              <li>No chemical residue &mdash; safe for children and pets</li>
              <li>Penetrates deep into mattresses, furniture, and wall voids</li>
              <li>Continuous temperature monitoring throughout treatment</li>
              <li>Return home the same day in most cases</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <!-- Chemical Treatment -->
          <div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #2980b9; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Chemical Treatment &mdash; Targeted &amp; Residual Protection</h3>
            <p>Chemical bed bug treatments use EPA-registered insecticides applied directly to bed bug harborage areas and travel paths. Our technicians are trained in the careful, targeted application of multiple product classes to prevent resistance and maximize effectiveness. We use a rotation of insecticide types &mdash; including contact killers, residual sprays, and dust formulations &mdash; to attack bed bugs through different modes of action.</p>
            <p>Residual chemical treatments leave a protective barrier that continues to kill bed bugs that emerge from hiding after the initial application. This is particularly important because bed bug eggs are often resistant to contact insecticides, meaning that newly hatched nymphs may emerge days after the initial treatment. Residual products help ensure those newly hatched bugs are eliminated before they can mature and reproduce.</p>
            <p>Chemical treatment programs typically involve an initial treatment followed by one or more follow-up visits. Our technicians inspect the property at each visit, treating any areas where bed bug activity is still detected and reinforcing residual product in key zones. We use only products that are safe when applied by licensed professionals following label directions, and we provide detailed instructions to occupants about precautions to take before and after treatment.</p>
            <ul style="line-height:2; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
              <li>EPA-registered professional-grade products</li>
              <li>Multiple product classes to prevent resistance</li>
              <li>Residual protection for continued kill after initial application</li>
              <li>Targeted application to minimize exposure</li>
              <li>Scheduled follow-up visits included</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <!-- Integrated Approach -->
          <div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #27ae60; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Integrated Pest Management &mdash; Best of Both Methods</h3>
            <p>For severe infestations or situations where a single method may not be sufficient, we recommend an integrated approach that combines the power of heat treatment with targeted chemical applications. Heat treatment rapidly eliminates the existing population, while residual chemical products provide ongoing protection against any bugs that may have survived in areas outside the heat treatment zone, or that may be re-introduced after treatment.</p>
            <p>Our integrated bed bug management programs also incorporate non-chemical tools such as mattress and box spring encasements, which trap any surviving bugs inside and prevent them from feeding until they die. Interceptor monitors placed under bed legs help detect any remaining bed bug activity. These passive monitoring tools allow our technicians to verify treatment success and detect early signs of re-infestation during follow-up visits.</p>
            <p>The integrated approach represents the highest level of bed bug management we offer and is backed by our strongest guarantee. We are confident that by combining methods and conducting thorough follow-up inspections, we can solve even the most challenging bed bug problems in Lafayette and across Acadiana.</p>

        <!-- Preparation Guide -->
        <section class="section">
          <h2>How to Prepare for Your Bed Bug Treatment</h2>
          <p>Proper preparation before your scheduled bed bug treatment is essential to the success of the service. Our technicians will provide you with a detailed preparation checklist when you schedule your appointment, but here is a general overview of what to expect. Completing all preparation steps before our arrival allows us to begin treatment immediately and ensures the best possible outcome.</p>

          <h3>Before Heat Treatment</h3>
          <ul style="line-height:2; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Remove all people, pets, and plants from the home for the duration of the treatment (typically 6 to 8 hours).</li>
            <li>Remove items that may be damaged by high temperatures: candles, aerosol cans, medications, perishable foods, and items containing alcohol or flammable materials.</li>
            <li>Remove plastic bags, dry-cleaning bags, and other plastic covers from items in the treatment area, as these can trap cold air and create heat shadows.</li>
            <li>Open all closet doors, dresser drawers, and cabinet doors to allow heat to circulate throughout all storage spaces.</li>
            <li>Do not bag up or relocate clothing, bedding, or other items from the infested area prior to treatment, as this can spread bugs to other parts of the home.</li>
            <li>Launder and dry all washable items on the highest heat setting and seal in clean bags after drying. Inform our technicians which items have been treated.</li>
            <li>Move furniture slightly away from walls if possible to allow heat circulation behind and beneath furniture.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Before Chemical Treatment</h3>
          <ul style="line-height:2; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Strip all beds of bedding and launder on the highest heat setting. Place in clean bags immediately after drying.</li>
            <li>Vacuum mattresses, box springs, carpets, and upholstered furniture thoroughly. Seal the vacuum bag or dispose of the canister contents in a sealed plastic bag immediately after vacuuming.</li>
            <li>Clear clutter from floors, under beds, and in closets to allow technicians access to all areas that need treatment.</li>
            <li>Remove all people and pets from the treatment area and ventilate the space after treatment per our technician&rsquo;s instructions.</li>
            <li>Do not clean, wipe, or vacuum treated surfaces for at least two weeks after application to preserve the residual chemical barrier.</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- Prevention Tips -->
        <section class="section">
          <h2>Bed Bug Prevention Tips</h2>
          <p>After successful treatment, protecting your home from future bed bug infestations requires ongoing vigilance. Bed bugs can be re-introduced at any time through travel, visitors, used furniture, or contaminated items. The following practices will significantly reduce your risk of a repeat infestation.</p>

          <div class="why-grid" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
            <div class="why-card">
              <h4>Travel Smart</h4>
              <p>Inspect hotel rooms carefully before unpacking &mdash; check mattress seams, headboards, and furniture joints. Keep luggage on luggage racks rather than on the floor or bed. Upon returning home, inspect your luggage outside and launder all clothing immediately on high heat.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="why-card">
              <h4>Be Careful with Used Furniture</h4>
              <p>Never bring used mattresses, box springs, or upholstered furniture into your home without a thorough inspection. Even items left curbside or purchased at thrift stores can harbor bed bugs. When in doubt, leave it out.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="why-card">
              <h4>Use Mattress Encasements</h4>
              <p>High-quality bed bug-proof encasements for your mattress and box spring eliminate key hiding spots and make bed bug activity much easier to detect during routine inspections. Look for encasements rated specifically for bed bugs with zipper locks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="why-card">
              <h4>Reduce Clutter</h4>
              <p>Clutter near sleeping areas provides ideal harborage for bed bugs and makes inspection and treatment more difficult. Keeping areas under and around beds clear and organized makes it easier to spot early signs of activity.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="why-card">
              <h4>Inspect Regularly</h4>
              <p>Make a habit of periodically inspecting mattress seams, bed frames, and nearby furniture &mdash; especially after having guests or returning from travel. Catching a small problem early makes treatment far simpler and less costly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="why-card">
              <h4>Schedule Annual Inspections</h4>
              <p>Acadiana Pest Solutions offers annual bed bug inspection programs for homeowners and property managers. Early detection is the single most effective defense against a full-scale infestation. Ask us about our inspection programs when you call.</p>

          <div class="services-grid" style="grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;">
            <div class="testimonial-card">
              <div style="color: #c0392b; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</div>
              <p>&ldquo;We discovered bed bugs after a family vacation and were completely panicked. Acadiana Pest Solutions came out the very next morning, did a thorough inspection, and performed heat treatment that same week. It has been four months and we have not seen a single bug. I cannot recommend them enough.&rdquo;</p>
              <strong>&mdash; Jennifer T., Lafayette, LA</strong>
            </div>

              <p>&ldquo;I manage several rental properties and had a tenant report bed bugs. The team at Acadiana Pest Solutions handled the whole situation professionally, kept me informed every step of the way, and the unit has been clear ever since. They understand the urgency when you are a landlord.&rdquo;</p>
              <strong>&mdash; Marcus D., Broussard, LA</strong>
            </div>

              <p>&ldquo;The technician was extremely knowledgeable and took the time to explain exactly what they were doing and why. The heat treatment worked perfectly &mdash; I followed up two weeks later and they confirmed no signs of activity. Great company, great service.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>&ldquo;After trying two other pest control companies with disappointing results, Acadiana Pest Solutions finally solved our bed bug problem for good. Their integrated approach and diligent follow-up visits made all the difference. Worth every penny.&rdquo;</p>

            <h2>Bed Bug Treatment FAQ</h2>
            <p>Common questions about our bed bug treatment services in Lafayette, LA.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How long does a bed bug heat treatment take? <span class="faq-question__icon">+</span></div>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>A typical heat treatment for a standard bedroom takes 6 to 8 hours. Larger spaces or whole-home treatments may take longer. Our technicians will give you a specific time estimate based on the size and layout of your home during the initial inspection.</p></div>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Do I need to throw away my mattress? <span class="faq-question__icon">+</span></div>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>In most cases, no. Heat treatment and chemical treatments can eliminate bed bugs from mattresses without requiring disposal. We often recommend installing a quality bed bug encasement after treatment to prevent re-infestation. We will advise you specifically during our inspection whether mattress replacement is warranted in your situation.</p></div>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How many treatments will I need? <span class="faq-question__icon">+</span></div>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>A single comprehensive heat treatment is often sufficient for a localized infestation. Chemical treatment programs typically involve an initial treatment and one or two follow-up visits 2 to 3 weeks apart. Our integrated programs may involve both methods plus monitoring visits. We will outline the recommended treatment plan and timeline during your inspection.</p></div>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Is heat treatment safe for my belongings? <span class="faq-question__icon">+</span></div>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>Heat treatment is safe for most household items when properly conducted. However, certain items should be removed before treatment, including candles, aerosols, alcohol-based products, medications, perishable foods, vinyl records, and other heat-sensitive materials. Our technicians will provide a complete pre-treatment checklist and answer any questions about specific items in your home.</p></div>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Will my neighbors get bed bugs if I have them treated? <span class="faq-question__icon">+</span></div>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>There is a small risk of bugs migrating to adjacent units during treatment, particularly in apartments. We can advise apartment dwellers and property managers on steps to minimize this risk, including treating adjacent units as a precaution. Addressing the problem promptly reduces the risk of spread significantly.</p></div>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How soon can I return home after treatment? <span class="faq-question__icon">+</span></div>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>For heat treatment, you can typically return home 2 to 3 hours after treatment is complete, once the space has cooled. For chemical treatments, re-entry time varies by product but is usually 2 to 4 hours after the application has dried. Our technicians will give you a specific re-entry time before they begin work.</p></div>
