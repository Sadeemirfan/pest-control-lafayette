          <h2>The Dangers of a Rodent Infestation in Your Home</h2>
          <p>Rodents are among the most destructive and health-threatening pests that can invade a Lafayette home or business. Mice and rats are not merely a nuisance &mdash; they pose serious risks to your family's health, the structural integrity of your property, and the safety of your electrical system. A single pair of mice can produce dozens of offspring within just a few months, meaning a small problem can quickly escalate into a full-scale infestation if left unaddressed.</p>
          <p>From a health standpoint, rodents are known carriers of dangerous diseases. They can spread Hantavirus, Salmonella, leptospirosis, and rat-bite fever through their droppings, urine, saliva, and direct contact. Rodent droppings contaminate food preparation surfaces and stored food products, and their urine can trigger asthma and allergy attacks in sensitive individuals. In Louisiana's warm and humid climate, the risk of rodent-borne illness is particularly pronounced, making prompt professional intervention essential.</p>
          <p>Structurally, rodents can cause severe damage in a very short period of time. Mice and rats have teeth that never stop growing, which compels them to gnaw constantly on whatever they find &mdash; including wooden beams, drywall, insulation, PVC piping, and aluminum. One of the most serious hazards is their tendency to chew through electrical wiring. Rodent-damaged wiring is a leading cause of house fires across the country, and this risk is one that should never be taken lightly. If you suspect rodents have been active in your attic, walls, or crawl spaces, it is critical to have a professional assess any potential electrical damage.</p>

        <!-- Signs of Rodents -->
        <section class="section">
          <h2>Warning Signs You Have a Rodent Problem</h2>
          <p>Rodents are primarily nocturnal and secretive by nature, which means a significant infestation can develop inside your walls or attic before you ever see a live animal. Knowing the early warning signs can help you catch a problem before it spirals out of control. The specialists at Acadiana Pest Solutions know exactly what to look for, but here are some common indicators that rodents may have taken up residence in your home:</p>
          <ul style="list-style:disc; padding-left:1.5rem; line-height:2;">
            <li><strong>Droppings:</strong> Rodent droppings are one of the clearest signs of an infestation. Mouse droppings are small, dark, and about the size of a grain of rice. Rat droppings are larger and capsule-shaped. You may find them in kitchen drawers, behind appliances, in cabinets, or along baseboards.</li>
            <li><strong>Gnaw marks:</strong> Look for chew marks on food packaging, wooden furniture, structural elements, and wiring. Fresh gnaw marks tend to be lighter in color, while older ones darken over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Scratching noises:</strong> If you hear scratching, scurrying, or squeaking sounds in your walls, ceilings, or attic &mdash; especially at night &mdash; there is a strong chance rodents are active in those spaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Nesting materials:</strong> Mice and rats build nests from shredded paper, fabric, insulation, and other soft materials. Nests are typically found in quiet, dark areas such as attic corners, inside wall voids, or behind large appliances.</li>
            <li><strong>Grease tracks and runways:</strong> Rodents follow the same paths repeatedly, leaving greasy smear marks along walls, baseboards, and rafters as their oily fur contacts surfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Footprints and tail drag marks:</strong> In dusty areas like attics or basements, you may spot rodent tracks or the drag marks left by a rat's tail.</li>
            <li><strong>Strange pet behavior:</strong> Dogs and cats may become fixated on certain areas of the home, pawing at walls or cabinets where they detect rodent activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Strong ammonia odor:</strong> A heavy infestation produces a distinctive musty odor from accumulated rodent urine.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you notice one or more of these warning signs, do not wait to call for help. Rodent populations grow rapidly, and the longer an infestation is allowed to continue, the more damage and health risk it creates.

        <!-- Types of Rodents -->
        <section class="section">
          <h2>Types of Rodents We Treat in Lafayette</h2>
          <p>The Acadiana region is home to several species of rodents that commonly invade residential and commercial properties. Understanding the type of rodent you are dealing with is important because each species has different habits, preferred entry points, and behaviors that influence the most effective treatment strategy.</p>

          <div class="services-grid" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
            <div class="service-card reveal">
              <div class="service-card__icon">[Mouse]</div>
              <h3 class="service-card__title">House Mice</h3>
              <p class="service-card__text">The house mouse (<em>Mus musculus</em>) is the most common rodent found in Lafayette homes. Mice are small &mdash; typically 2 to 4 inches in body length &mdash; with large ears and a pointed snout. They can squeeze through openings as small as a dime, which makes excluding them particularly challenging. Mice prefer to nest close to food sources and are often found inside walls, behind refrigerators and stoves, and inside kitchen cabinets. A female mouse can produce 5 to 10 litters per year with 5 to 6 pups per litter, so populations can explode rapidly. Our treatment plans for mice focus on strategic trap placement, bait stations, and thorough exclusion work to seal entry points.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-card reveal">
              <div class="service-card__icon">[Rat]</div>
              <h3 class="service-card__title">Norway Rats</h3>
              <p class="service-card__text">Norway rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>), also known as sewer rats or brown rats, are the largest rat species commonly found in Acadiana. These burrowingrodents can reach 7 to 9 inches in body length and typically nest underground, in crawl spaces, under slabs, or in lower levels of buildings. They are excellent swimmers, which makes them particularly prevalent in Louisiana's flood-prone landscape. Norway rats are aggressive chewers and can cause significant damage to foundations, plumbing, and underground utility lines. Their strong jaws allow them to gnaw through concrete, lead pipes, and aluminum sheeting. Our Norway rat removal program includes targeted snap trap and bait station deployment along established runways, combined with burrow treatment and exclusion work.</p>

            <div class="service-card reveal">
              <div class="service-card__icon">[Rat]</div>
              <h3 class="service-card__title">Roof Rats</h3>
              <p class="service-card__text">Roof rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>), also called black rats or citrus rats, are highly agile climbers that prefer elevated nesting sites. They are commonly found in attics, soffits, treetops, and along utility lines in Lafayette neighborhoods. Roof rats are sleeker and more slender than Norway rats, typically measuring 6 to 8 inches with a tail longer than their body. They are particularly attracted to fruit trees, which are abundant throughout South Louisiana, and they often enter homes by climbing overhanging branches or utility lines to access rooflines. Roof rat infestations are especially common in older Lafayette neighborhoods with mature tree canopies. Our roof rat treatment focuses on attic trapping, exterior bait station placement, and comprehensive roof-line exclusion.</p>

            <div class="service-card reveal">
              <div class="service-card__icon">[Squirrel]</div>
              <h3 class="service-card__title">Squirrels</h3>
              <p class="service-card__text">While squirrels may seem harmless when viewed at a backyard feeder, they become a serious pest problem when they move inside your attic or walls. Eastern gray squirrels are extremely common throughout Lafayette and surrounding Acadiana communities, and they frequently exploit gaps around roof vents, damaged soffits, and uncapped chimneys to gain entry. Once inside, squirrels build large nests, contaminate insulation with urine and droppings, and gnaw on wiring and structural wood. Unlike mice and rats, squirrels are diurnal &mdash; meaning they are active during the day &mdash; so you may hear them in the morning and afternoon rather than at night. Our squirrel removal program uses live exclusion traps and one-way door devices to safely remove squirrels, followed by thorough exclusion to prevent re-entry.</p>

        <!-- Removal Process -->
        <section class="section">
          <h2>Our 4-Step Rodent Removal Process</h2>
          <p>At Acadiana Pest Solutions, we follow a proven, systematic approach to rodent control that goes far beyond simply setting a few traps. Our process is designed to eliminate the current infestation, identify and seal all entry points, and put long-term prevention measures in place so that rodents do not return. Every rodent control program is customized to the specific species, property layout, and severity of the infestation.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Our licensed technician will conduct a comprehensive inspection of your property, both inside and out. We examine the attic, crawl spaces, basement, walls, garage, and perimeter foundation for evidence of rodent activity. We identify the species responsible, assess the extent of the infestation, locate nesting sites and harborage areas, and catalog every potential entry point &mdash; including gaps as small as a quarter inch for mice or a half-inch for rats. We also evaluate conditions that may be attracting rodents, such as food storage practices, overgrown vegetation, woodpile placement, and debris around the foundation. This inspection forms the foundation of your customized treatment plan.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Once the inspection is complete, we deploy a targeted combination of snap traps, bait stations, and in some cases live-capture traps, positioned strategically along active runways, near entry points, and in nesting areas. The specific devices used and their placement depend on the species, the severity of infestation, and the presence of children or pets in the home. We use professional-grade equipment and EPA-registered rodenticide products where appropriate. Our technicians check and service traps on a scheduled basis, remove captured rodents and dead animals, and adjust placement as needed to maximize effectiveness. We monitor activity levels throughout the treatment period to ensure the population is being successfully reduced.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Trapping alone does not solve a rodent problem permanently. As long as entry points remain open, new rodents from outside will continue to find their way in. That is why exclusion &mdash; the physical sealing of all entry points &mdash; is the most critical long-term step in our rodent control program. Our technicians seal gaps around pipes, conduits, and utility penetrations; install heavy-gauge wire mesh or galvanized steel hardware cloth over vents and weep holes; apply professional-grade sealant and rodent-proof foam to cracks in the foundation and exterior walls; and install door sweeps on garage doors and entry doors with gaps. Exclusion work is thorough, durable, and designed to stand up to Louisiana's heat, humidity, and seasonal weather extremes.</p>

                <p>After active removal and exclusion work are complete, we provide a detailed prevention plan to help you keep rodents from returning. This includes recommendations on food storage, garbage management, landscaping adjustments such as trimming tree branches away from the roofline, removing wood piles and debris from the home's perimeter, and addressing any moisture issues that may attract rodents. We also offer ongoing rodent monitoring programs with exterior bait station networks that provide a first line of defense, intercepting rodents before they can get inside your home. Quarterly or bi-monthly service agreements are available and are highly recommended for properties in wooded areas, near commercial food facilities, or in neighborhoods with a known history of rodent activity.</p>

        <!-- Damage Repair -->
        <section class="section">
          <h2>Rodent Damage Repair Services</h2>
          <p>A rodent infestation leaves more than just pest activity behind &mdash; it often leaves a trail of significant physical damage that must be addressed before the affected areas are safe and functional again. At Acadiana Pest Solutions, our services extend beyond pest removal to include assessment and recommendations for damage repair, and we work with trusted local contractors to help restore your property.</p>
          <p>One of the most commonly affected areas in Lafayette homes is the attic. Roof rats and squirrels in particular can devastate attic insulation, soiling it with urine and droppings, compressing it, and reducing its insulating value. We offer contaminated attic insulation removal and replacement services to restore your home's energy efficiency and eliminate the health hazards associated with rodent-contaminated material. Proper disposal of contaminated insulation is handled in compliance with health and safety guidelines.</p>
          <p>We also assess ductwork for damage, particularly in homes with flexible duct systems in the attic or crawl space. Rodents readily gnaw through flexible duct material to access the warmth and shelter inside. Damaged ducts not only reduce HVAC efficiency but can circulate rodent contamination throughout your home's air supply. Our inspection will identify any compromised ductwork and provide recommendations for repair or replacement.</p>
          <p>For wiring damage, we strongly recommend having a licensed electrician inspect any areas where rodent activity has been confirmed near electrical components. Our technicians will flag areas of concern during the inspection and provide documentation to help facilitate that process. Taking wiring damage seriously is not optional &mdash; it is a fire safety necessity.</p>

We are fully insured, and we stand behind our work with a satisfaction guarantee. If rodents return between scheduled service visits, we come back at no additional charge.

              How quickly can you respond to a rodent problem in Lafayette?

            <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
              <p>We offer same-day service for rodent control calls received Monday through Saturday before 2 PM. We understand that rodent infestations are urgent &mdash; especially when children or immunocompromised family members are in the home &mdash; and we make every effort to respond as quickly as possible. Call us at <a href="tel:3375550199">(337) 555-0199</a> and one of our scheduling coordinators will find the earliest available appointment for you.</p>

              How long does it take to get rid of a rodent infestation?
              <span class="faq-question__icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
              <p>The timeline depends on the severity of the infestation, the species involved, and the size of your property. A mild mouse infestation in a single-family home may be resolved within 1 to 2 weeks. A moderate to severe rat infestation can take 3 to 6 weeks of active treatment. Exclusion work is typically completed within the first two service visits. We provide realistic timelines during the initial inspection and keep you updated throughout the process.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
              Are the products you use safe for children and pets?
              <span class="faq-question__icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
              <p>The safety of your family and pets is our top priority. We use tamper-resistant bait stations that are inaccessible to children and non-target animals when rodenticides are part of the treatment plan. We also make extensive use of snap traps and mechanical control methods that carry no chemical risk. Our technicians will advise you on any brief precautions to take following treatment, and all products used are EPA-registered for residential use. We are happy to discuss any specific concerns during your consultation.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
              Can I just buy traps at the hardware store and do it myself?
              <span class="faq-question__icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
              <p>DIY trapping can provide temporary relief, but it rarely solves the underlying problem. Store-bought traps placed incorrectly are often ineffective. More importantly, without identifying and sealing all entry points, new rodents will continue to enter the structure even as you catch existing ones. Professional rodent control addresses the full scope of the problem &mdash; removal, exclusion, and prevention &mdash; which is the only approach that delivers lasting results. Our prices are competitive, and the cost of professional treatment is almost always far less than the cost of the damage an untreated infestation can cause.</p>
