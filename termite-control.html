          <h2>The Termite Threat in Lafayette and Acadiana</h2>
          <p>Termites are responsible for more than <strong>$5 billion in property damage</strong> across the United States every single year &mdash; and Louisiana homeowners bear a disproportionate share of that burden. The warm, humid climate of Acadiana creates near-perfect conditions for Formosan subterranean termites, one of the most aggressive and destructive termite species in the world. Unlike many pests that are merely a nuisance, termites silently consume the structural wood of your home 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, often going undetected for months or even years before the damage becomes visible.</p>
          <p>At Acadiana Pest Solutions, we have spent years studying local termite behavior patterns, soil conditions, and building construction styles common to the Lafayette area. That local knowledge allows us to identify vulnerabilities in your specific property and deliver targeted treatments that genuinely work. We do not rely on one-size-fits-all approaches. Every home and every infestation is unique, and our termite programs are designed accordingly. Whether you are dealing with an active infestation or simply want to protect a home you have just purchased, we have the tools and expertise to keep your investment safe.</p>
          <p>Standard homeowners insurance typically does not cover termite damage, which means the repair costs come entirely out of your pocket. A mature termite colony can number in the hundreds of thousands of individuals, consuming approximately one pound of wood per day. Over several years, this can translate into tens of thousands of dollars in structural repairs &mdash; damage to floor joists, wall studs, roof supports, and even concrete foundations where termites exploit cracks to reach wooden materials. The smartest and most cost-effective decision any Lafayette homeowner can make is investing in professional termite control before damage occurs.</p>

          <!-- Signs of Termites Section -->
          <h2>Signs You May Have a Termite Problem</h2>
          <p>Because termites work inside walls, below floors, and underground, many infestations are well advanced before homeowners realize anything is wrong. Knowing what to look for can help you catch a problem early and limit the extent of costly damage. Here are the most common warning signs our technicians look for during inspections:</p>

          <div class="why-grid" style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
            <div class="why-card reveal">
              <h3>Mud Tubes</h3>
              <p>Subterranean termites build pencil-width mud tubes along foundations, walls, and pipes to travel between their underground colony and their food source. These are one of the clearest signs of active termite activity. Even an empty mud tube is cause for concern, as the colony may have simply shifted its route.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="why-card reveal">
              <h3>Swarming Termites</h3>
              <p>Winged termites, called alates or swarmers, emerge in spring and early summer to start new colonies. If you see swarms of winged insects near light sources, windows, or doorways &mdash; or find discarded wings in piles &mdash; a mature colony is almost certainly nearby. Swarms are often mistaken for flying ants; a trained eye can tell the difference.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="why-card reveal">
              <h3>Hollow or Blistered Wood</h3>
              <p>Wood that sounds hollow when you tap it, floors that feel springy underfoot, or paint that bubbles and blisters without an obvious moisture source are all indicators of termite damage beneath the surface. Termites eat wood from the inside out, leaving a thin outer shell that can crack or cave in under normal use.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="why-card reveal">
              <h3>Frass (Termite Droppings)</h3>
              <p>Drywood termites push their fecal pellets, called frass, out of their galleries. If you find small piles of what appears to be fine sawdust or coffee grounds near wood surfaces, baseboards, or windowsills, this may indicate a drywood termite infestation. Frass is often the only outward evidence of an active colony.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="why-card reveal">
              <h3>Tight-Fitting Doors and Windows</h3>
              <p>When termites tunnel through door frames and window frames, the structural damage they cause can warp the wood, making doors and windows difficult to open or close. Many homeowners attribute this to settling or humidity when termites are actually the cause.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="why-card reveal">
              <h3>Visible Damage to Wood Structures</h3>
              <p>In severe infestations, you may be able to see actual channels or galleries carved into exposed wood in crawl spaces, attics, or basements. Honeycomb-like patterns inside wood that crumbles when probed with a screwdriver are a definitive sign of termite damage.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>If you have noticed any of these signs &mdash; or if you simply have not had a termite inspection in the past year &mdash; call Acadiana Pest Solutions at <a href="tel:3375550199">(337) 555-0199</a> today. We provide free, no-obligation termite inspections for homeowners throughout Lafayette and the surrounding Acadiana communities.</p>

          <!-- Treatment Options Section -->
          <h2>Our Termite Treatment Options</h2>
          <p>There is no single termite treatment that is right for every situation. The type of termite, the extent of the infestation, the construction of your home, and your long-term protection goals all factor into the treatment plan we recommend. Acadiana Pest Solutions offers three primary termite treatment methods, and in many cases we combine approaches for maximum effectiveness.</p>

          <h3>1. Liquid Soil Barrier Treatment (Termiticide)</h3>
          <p>Liquid barrier treatments are one of the most effective and time-tested methods of termite control. Our technicians apply a professional-grade termiticide to the soil around and beneath your home, creating an invisible chemical barrier that either kills termites on contact or causes them to pick up the treatment and carry it back to the colony, where it spreads to other members. We use industry-leading products such as Termidor and Altriset, which are proven effective against Formosan subterranean termites &mdash; the dominant species in South Louisiana.</p>
          <p>To apply a complete liquid barrier, our team trenches around the perimeter of your foundation, treats the soil, and backfills the trench. We also drill through concrete slabs and patios as needed to ensure complete coverage. This method provides lasting protection, often for five years or more, and is backed by a written warranty. Liquid barriers are particularly effective for treating existing infestations and for protecting high-risk properties.</p>

          <h3>2. Termite Bait Systems</h3>
          <p>Termite bait systems offer a low-impact, environmentally sensitive approach to termite control that is ideal for properties where liquid treatments are impractical or for homeowners who prefer a monitoring-based solution. We install in-ground bait stations at strategic intervals around the perimeter of your property. These stations contain a cellulose-based material that attracts termites. When foraging termites find the bait, we replace it with a slow-acting insect growth regulator that termites carry back to the colony and share with nestmates, eventually collapsing the entire colony.</p>
          <p>Bait systems require regular monitoring visits to ensure bait is being consumed and to replenish stations as needed. We check your bait stations on a scheduled basis and report our findings to you after each visit. Bait systems work more slowly than liquid treatments but ultimately eliminate the colony rather than simply creating a barrier around it. They also use far less chemical product, making them a preferred option near water features, wells, and environmentally sensitive areas.</p>

          <h3>3. Wood Treatment and Spot Applications</h3>
          <p>Wood treatments are an important complement to liquid and bait approaches, particularly for localized infestations or for protecting exposed structural wood in crawl spaces, attics, and basements. We apply borate-based products such as Bora-Care and Timbor directly to wood surfaces. Borate penetrates deep into wood fibers and remains active for the life of the treated wood, killing termites that attempt to eat it. Borate treatments also work against wood-decay fungi, providing dual protection for vulnerable areas.</p>
          <p>Spot applications are useful for treating small, contained infestations in specific areas of a home &mdash; for example, a section of wall framing that shows evidence of termite activity. Our technicians drill small holes in drywall or flooring to access affected cavities, inject termiticide foam or dust, and then patch the entry points. Spot treatments minimize disruption to your home while delivering precise, targeted control exactly where it is needed.</p>

          <!-- Our Process Section -->
          <h2>Our Termite Control Process</h2>
          <p>We believe that effective termite control starts with thorough preparation and clear communication. Here is exactly what you can expect when you work with Acadiana Pest Solutions:</p>

          <ol class="process-list" style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 2;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
              <strong>Step 1: Free Comprehensive Termite Inspection</strong><br>
              One of our licensed termite inspectors will visit your property at a time that is convenient for you. We conduct a thorough inspection of all accessible interior and exterior areas, including the attic, crawl space, basement (if applicable), foundation walls, plumbing penetrations, utility entries, attached garages, porches, decks, and outbuildings. We document all evidence of termite activity, conducive conditions, and prior damage. At the end of the inspection, we sit down with you and walk through our findings in plain language, answer all your questions, and present our recommended treatment plan with transparent pricing.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
              <strong>Step 2: Customized Treatment Plan</strong><br>
              Based on our inspection findings, the construction type of your home, the species identified, and the extent of any infestation, we design a treatment plan tailored to your specific property. We explain the products we will use, the application methods, any preparation steps required on your part, and what to expect during and after treatment. We never pressure you into a service you do not need, and we take the time to make sure you fully understand what we are recommending and why.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
              <strong>Step 3: Professional Treatment Application</strong><br>
              Our certified technicians carry out the treatment precisely according to the plan. For liquid barrier treatments, this involves careful trenching, drilling, and soil injection to ensure complete, uninterrupted coverage around the entire perimeter of your structure. For bait systems, we install stations at the specified intervals and document each location. For wood treatments, we apply products evenly to all targeted surfaces. We work efficiently and cleanly, taking care to protect your landscaping and minimize disruption to your household routine.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
              <strong>Step 4: Follow-Up, Monitoring, and Warranty Service</strong><br>
              After treatment, we schedule follow-up inspections to verify that the treatment is performing as expected and that termite activity has ceased. For properties enrolled in our annual termite protection program, we conduct regular monitoring visits throughout the year and provide a renewable warranty that covers re-treatment at no additional cost if termites return during the coverage period. We maintain detailed service records for every property and provide documentation that can be used for real estate transactions, lender requirements, and insurance purposes.

                Does my homeowners insurance cover termite damage?

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>In almost all cases, standard homeowners insurance policies do not cover termite damage. Insurers classify termite damage as a preventable maintenance issue rather than a sudden, accidental event. This makes professional termite prevention all the more important &mdash; the cost of a treatment program is a fraction of what you could pay out-of-pocket for structural repairs after a serious infestation.</p>
