      <h2 class="section-header__title">The Termite Threat in Acadiana: What Lafayette Homeowners Must Know</h2>
      <p class="section-header__sub">Louisiana has the highest concentration of Formosan subterranean termites in the United States. If you live in Lafayette, Broussard, or anywhere in the Acadiana region, your home is at risk every single day of the year &mdash; not just during swarm season.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="two-col">
      <div class="two-col__text">
        <h3>Formosan Subterranean Termites: Louisiana&rsquo;s Most Destructive Pest</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Formosan subterranean termite</strong> (<em>Coptotermes formosanus</em>) was introduced to Louisiana through port activity decades ago, and it has never left. Unlike native subterranean termites, Formosan colonies can number in the <strong>millions</strong> &mdash; up to 10 times larger than a typical native termite colony. A single Formosan colony can consume up to 31 grams of wood per day, destroying a one-foot length of 2x4 lumber in just 25 days.</p>
        <p>In Lafayette and the broader Acadiana region, our warm, humid subtropical climate and clay-heavy, moisture-retaining soils create the perfect environment for these insects to thrive year-round. Properties near waterways like the <strong>Vermilion River</strong>, Bayou Teche, and the many drainage canals and retention ponds throughout Lafayette Parish are especially vulnerable because elevated soil moisture supports larger, more aggressive termite colonies.</p>
        <p>Beyond Formosan termites, Louisiana homeowners also face infestations from <strong>Eastern subterranean termites</strong> (<em>Reticulitermes flavipes</em>), the most widespread termite species in North America, as well as <strong>drywood termites</strong> that infest wood directly without needing soil contact. Each species requires a tailored treatment approach &mdash; which is why professional inspection is critical before any treatment begins.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Louisiana Termite Swarm Season: March Through May</h3>
        <p>If you&rsquo;ve ever seen a cloud of winged insects emerge from the ground or from a crack in your foundation on a warm spring evening, you&rsquo;ve witnessed a termite swarm. In Lafayette, <strong>Formosan termites typically swarm from late March through May</strong>, usually after a rain event when temperatures are above 70&deg;F. Native subterranean termites may begin swarming as early as February.</p>
        <p>Swarmers &mdash; also called alates &mdash; are the reproductive members of the colony. Their appearance doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean your home is currently infested; they may originate from a colony in a neighboring yard or tree stump. However, if you observe swarmers indoors &mdash; particularly near windows, doors, or light fixtures &mdash; this is a strong indicator that an <strong>active colony already exists within your structure</strong> and immediate professional assessment is essential.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header__title">The Real Cost of Termite Damage to Your Lafayette Home</h2>
      <p class="section-header__sub">Termites are called the &ldquo;silent destroyers&rdquo; for good reason &mdash; by the time most homeowners discover an infestation, significant structural damage has already occurred.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="damage-grid">
      <div class="damage-card">
        <div class="damage-card__icon">&#127968;</div>
        <h3 class="damage-card__title">Structural Damage</h3>
        <p class="damage-card__text">Termites attack load-bearing beams, floor joists, wall studs, and roof rafters. In severe infestations, they can compromise the structural integrity of an entire home. Repairs to structural wood can cost <strong>$3,000 to $30,000 or more</strong> depending on the extent of damage. Many Lafayette homes with pier-and-beam or raised foundations are especially vulnerable because subterranean termites access wood directly from the soil.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="damage-card">
        <div class="damage-card__icon">&#128265;</div>
        <h3 class="damage-card__title">Flooring &amp; Subfloor Damage</h3>
        <p class="damage-card__text">Soft, squeaky, or sagging floors are a common sign of termite damage beneath your feet. Termites hollow out subfloor joists and plywood sheeting, making floors unsafe. Replacing termite-damaged flooring and subfloor materials in a typical Lafayette home can range from <strong>$1,500 to $10,000</strong> per room, not including the cost of refinishing or replacing surface flooring.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="damage-card">
        <div class="damage-card__icon">&#128250;</div>
        <h3 class="damage-card__title">Drywall &amp; Interior Damage</h3>
        <p class="damage-card__text">Formosan termites create carton nests inside walls using a mixture of soil, wood, and their own saliva &mdash; trapping moisture and accelerating wood rot. This causes bubbling paint, stained walls, and crumbling drywall. Interior repair costs can reach <strong>$2,000 to $8,000</strong> or more for widespread infestations throughout a home.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="damage-card">
        <div class="damage-card__icon">&#128205;</div>
        <h3 class="damage-card__title">Real Estate &amp; Insurance Impact</h3>
        <p class="damage-card__text">Active or prior termite infestations must typically be disclosed during real estate transactions in Louisiana. An active infestation can derail a home sale or significantly reduce your property&rsquo;s market value. Importantly, <strong>most standard homeowner&rsquo;s insurance policies do not cover termite damage</strong> &mdash; making prevention and annual inspections a financial necessity, not just a precaution.</p>

        <div class="damage-card__icon">&#9889;</div>
        <h3 class="damage-card__title">Electrical &amp; Plumbing Hazards</h3>
        <p class="damage-card__text">Termites don&rsquo;t limit themselves to wood. They chew through electrical wiring insulation, foam pipe insulation, and even thin plastic water lines inside walls. Damaged wiring creates a <strong>fire hazard</strong>, while chewed pipe insulation accelerates corrosion and can lead to water leaks that further worsen moisture conditions ideal for termite activity.</p>

        <div class="damage-card__icon">&#127758;</div>
        <h3 class="damage-card__title">Acadiana&rsquo;s Unique Risk Factors</h3>
        <p class="damage-card__text">The Acadiana region&rsquo;s clay soils retain moisture exceptionally well, and our proximity to rivers, bayous, and the Gulf of Mexico keeps humidity elevated throughout the year. Properties near the <strong>Vermilion River corridor</strong> and low-lying areas in Lafayette Parish experience some of the highest termite pressure in the state. New construction is not immune &mdash; Formosan termites have been known to infest structures less than two years old.</p>

          <h3 class="step__title">Comprehensive Termite Inspection</h3>
          <p>Our inspection is the foundation of everything. A licensed termite inspector conducts a thorough visual examination of your home&rsquo;s interior and exterior, including the attic, crawl space or pier-and-beam foundation, basement (if applicable), garage, and all accessible structural wood. We probe suspect areas with a moisture meter and use a flashlight and pick tool to identify mud tubes, hollowed wood, frass, live termites, and evidence of past treatments. We also assess moisture conditions, wood-to-soil contact points, and landscaping that may contribute to termite risk. After the inspection, we provide you with a written report detailing our findings and recommended treatment options with clear pricing.</p>

          <h3 class="step__title">Liquid Termiticide Barrier Treatment</h3>
          <p>The liquid barrier method is the most widely used and immediately effective termite treatment available. Our technicians trench and treat the soil around the entire perimeter of your foundation, creating a continuous chemical barrier that termites cannot cross. For slab foundations &mdash; common in Lafayette &mdash; we drill through the slab at regular intervals to treat the soil directly beneath the concrete, then seal the drill holes. We use industry-leading non-repellent termiticides such as <strong>Termidor&reg; (fipronil)</strong> or <strong>Altriset&reg;</strong>, which termites cannot detect. Because these products are non-repellent, foraging termites pass through the treated zone, pick up the active ingredient on their bodies, and carry it back to the colony &mdash; achieving a &ldquo;transfer effect&rdquo; that kills the entire colony, not just the termites that come into contact with the chemical directly. Liquid barrier treatments typically provide protection for <strong>five or more years</strong> when properly applied.</p>

          <h3 class="step__title">Termite Bait Station Systems</h3>
          <p>For ongoing monitoring and environmentally conscious termite management, we install the <strong>Sentricon&reg; System</strong> or equivalent bait station network around the perimeter of your property. Bait stations are inserted into the ground at 10-12 foot intervals and contain a cellulose bait matrix. Termites prefer the bait over surrounding wood and feed on it actively, carrying the active ingredient (noviflumuron or diflubenzuron) back to the colony. This disrupts molting and colony reproduction, ultimately collapsing the entire colony. Bait systems are particularly valuable for properties with difficult-to-treat areas, such as homes with deep footings, homes adjacent to water features, or properties where liquid treatments pose environmental concerns. We service bait stations every three to four months, documenting activity levels and replenishing bait as needed.</p>

          <h3 class="step__title">Spot Treatments &amp; Wood Treatments</h3>
          <p>For drywood termite infestations or localized subterranean activity in a specific area, spot treatments may be appropriate as a standalone solution or supplement to a whole-home treatment. We inject termiticide foam or liquid directly into galleries within infested wood through drilled access holes, killing termites within the treated area. For existing exposed wood in crawl spaces, attics, and decks, we apply <strong>borate wood treatments</strong> (such as Tim-bor&reg; or Bora-Care&reg;) that penetrate deep into the wood fiber and remain effective for the life of the wood, providing permanent protection against termites, wood-boring beetles, and wood-decay fungi. Borate treatments are low-toxicity to humans and pets once dry, making them an excellent choice for interior applications.</p>

          <h3 class="step__title">Fumigation (Tenting) for Drywood Termites</h3>
          <p>When a drywood termite infestation is extensive and has spread throughout multiple areas of a home, whole-structure fumigation may be the most thorough solution. Fumigation involves enclosing the entire structure in a specialized tent and introducing a gas fumigant (typically sulfuryl fluoride) that penetrates all wood in the structure, eliminating all termites at every life stage. While tenting requires temporary evacuation of your home for 24-72 hours and does not prevent future infestations, it is the most complete solution for widespread drywood termite problems. Our team coordinates every aspect of the fumigation process, including scheduling, pre-treatment preparation guidance, and post-treatment aeration clearance testing to ensure your home is completely safe before you return.</p>

          <h3 class="step__title">Annual Renewal Inspections &amp; Warranties</h3>
          <p>The Louisiana termite treatment industry operates differently from most pest control services &mdash; termite treatments typically come with an annual renewal warranty (often called an &ldquo;HB 869 warranty&rdquo; in Louisiana real estate transactions). After your initial treatment, we schedule an annual inspection to verify that the treatment zone remains intact, check bait station activity, and assess any new conditions that may have developed. If termites are found to be active within the warranty period, we re-treat at no additional cost under most warranty terms. Annual inspections are also essential for satisfying Louisiana mortgage and real estate requirements &mdash; most lenders require a current termite inspection (WDI report) and active warranty for home purchases in the region.</p>

      <h2 class="section-header__title">Termite Prevention Tips for Lafayette Homeowners</h2>
      <p class="section-header__sub">While professional treatment is the most reliable way to eliminate an active infestation, there are important steps Lafayette homeowners can take to reduce termite attractants and make their property less hospitable to these destructive insects.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tips-grid">
      <div class="tip-card">
        <div class="tip-card__icon">&#128167;</div>
        <h4 class="tip-card__title">Manage Moisture Around Your Foundation</h4>
        <p>Termites need moisture to survive. Fix leaky faucets, HVAC condensation lines, and sprinkler heads that wet your foundation. Ensure gutters are clean and downspouts direct water at least three feet away from your home&rsquo;s exterior. Grade soil so it slopes away from your foundation. Homes near the Vermilion River drainage basin or in low-lying areas of Lafayette should be especially vigilant about moisture management during the rainy season.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tip-card">
        <div class="tip-card__icon">&#127795;</div>
        <h4 class="tip-card__title">Eliminate Wood-to-Soil Contact</h4>
        <p>Direct contact between wooden structural elements and soil is a primary termite entry point. Maintain at least six inches of clearance between soil and any wood on your home, including siding, door frames, deck posts, and fence posts. Replace wooden landscape timbers touching your foundation with concrete or composite alternatives. Never store firewood directly against your home&rsquo;s exterior &mdash; keep wood piles elevated and at least 20 feet from the house.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tip-card">
        <div class="tip-card__icon">&#127984;</div>
        <h4 class="tip-card__title">Be Careful With Mulch</h4>
        <p>Wood mulch retains moisture and can harbor termite colonies. Avoid placing mulch directly against your home&rsquo;s foundation or siding. Leave a 12-18 inch gap between mulch beds and your structure. Consider using rubber, gravel, or pine straw mulch alternatives near your home&rsquo;s perimeter, which are far less attractive to termites than wood-based products.</p>

        <p>Poor ventilation leads to humidity buildup in crawl spaces and attics &mdash; two of the most common locations for termite activity in Acadiana homes. Ensure your crawl space has adequate cross-ventilation, consider installing a vapor barrier over exposed soil, and if your home has significant moisture issues, a crawl space dehumidifier can dramatically reduce termite-friendly conditions.</p>

        <h4 class="tip-card__title">Remove Dead Wood &amp; Stumps</h4>
        <p>Dead tree stumps, roots, and buried wood debris serve as termite starter colonies that eventually expand into nearby structures. Remove dead stumps on your property, particularly those within 50 feet of your home. After removing a stump, treat the remaining root system or grind it down completely. Dead trees, fallen branches, and wood piles left in contact with the ground should be cleared promptly.</p>

        <h4 class="tip-card__title">Schedule Annual Professional Inspections</h4>
        <p>Even with all preventive measures in place, the only way to reliably catch a termite infestation before it becomes expensive is through an annual professional inspection. A trained termite inspector knows exactly where to look and what signs are easy to miss. Annual inspections are especially critical for older Lafayette homes with pier-and-beam foundations, wood siding, or wood decks and porches that provide abundant termite access points.</p>

          <div itemprop="text">
            <p>Formosan and Eastern subterranean termites are difficult to distinguish without close examination, but there are some key differences. Formosan termite swarmers are slightly larger (about 5/8 inch including wings) and yellowish-brown, while native subterranean swarmers are darker and smaller. More importantly, Formosan termite colonies are dramatically larger &mdash; often 10 to 50 times the size of native subterranean colonies. Formosans also build distinctive above-ground carton nests inside walls, containing a mixture of soil, chewed wood, and saliva. If you find termites on your property, the most reliable way to identify the species is to have a licensed pest control professional examine them. Proper species identification matters because Formosan termites require more aggressive treatment due to their massive colony size and voracious feeding activity. Call us at (337) 555-0199 and we&rsquo;ll send a specialist to identify what you&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>

          <div itemprop="text">
            <p>Liquid termiticide barrier treatments using products like Termidor&reg; typically remain effective for 5 to 10 years when properly applied, though soil conditions, construction type, and environmental factors can affect longevity. Bait station systems like Sentricon&reg; provide ongoing protection as long as the stations are actively maintained and serviced. Regardless of treatment type, Louisiana pest control regulations and industry best practices call for <strong>annual inspections</strong>. Annual inspections allow your technician to verify the integrity of the treatment zone, catch any new termite activity early, service bait stations, and renew your warranty. Annual renewals are also typically required to maintain a transferable termite warranty, which is necessary for most mortgage transactions in Louisiana. Think of it like a smoke detector battery replacement &mdash; a small annual investment that protects everything you&rsquo;ve built.</p>

            <p>The termiticides we use are EPA-registered and have been extensively tested for safety. Products like Termidor&reg; (fipronil) are applied into the soil at low concentrations and present minimal risk to humans and pets once the treated areas have dried. During and immediately after liquid barrier application, we ask that people and pets stay off treated soil until it has dried &mdash; typically a few hours. For interior bait stations and borate wood treatments, there is no need to vacate your home during or after application. We always provide you with a product Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for any material applied to your property, and our technicians are happy to answer any specific health questions before treatment begins. If you have young children, pregnant family members, or pets with particular sensitivities, let us know so we can discuss the safest treatment approach for your situation.</p>

          <div itemprop="text">
            <p>Yes &mdash; a Wood-Destroying Insect (WDI) inspection report is almost universally required by lenders for home purchases in Louisiana, and it is strongly advisable for any buyer even when not required. A WDI inspection performed by a licensed Louisiana pest control company examines the property for evidence of active or previous termite activity, wood-boring beetles, and wood decay. If an active infestation is found, treatment is typically required (and paid for by the seller) before closing. If prior evidence is found, the buyer must decide how to proceed with full knowledge of the property&rsquo;s history. We issue WDI reports quickly and affordably for buyers, sellers, and real estate agents throughout Lafayette and the Acadiana region. Call us at (337) 555-0199 to schedule your pre-purchase termite inspection.</p>

            <p>Termite treatment costs in Lafayette vary based on the size of your home, the type of foundation, the species of termite involved, the extent of the infestation, and the treatment method selected. As a general guide, liquid barrier treatments for a typical Lafayette home (1,500-2,500 square feet on a slab foundation) typically range from <strong>$800 to $2,000</strong> for initial treatment, with annual renewal inspections ranging from $150 to $300. Bait station system installation runs $1,200 to $2,500 or more depending on perimeter size, with quarterly service fees. Fumigation for severe drywood infestations is typically $1,500 to $3,500 or more for an average home. Every property is different, which is why we provide free, no-obligation estimates after a thorough inspection. Compare the cost of treatment to the average $10,000-$30,000 in repair costs for structural termite damage &mdash; and the choice to treat proactively becomes very clear.
