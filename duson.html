          <h2>Protecting Duson Homes &amp; Businesses from Local Pests</h2>
          <p>Duson is a tight-knit community sitting right on the I-10 corridor about eight miles west of Lafayette. It's a place where crawfish boils happen in the backyard, neighbors know each other by name, and the smell of rice fields in summer is part of everyday life. That agricultural backdrop &mdash; the rice paddies, irrigation ditches, and open land that stretch north and south of the interstate &mdash; creates a perfect environment for a wide range of pests to thrive.</p>
          <p>From the residential streets near Duson's small downtown to the newer subdivisions that have popped up as Lafayette sprawl creeps westward, pest pressure here is real and year-round. Louisiana's subtropical climate means insects don't get a winter break, and Duson's proximity to standing water in agricultural areas makes it one of the more pest-active communities in Lafayette Parish.</p>
          <p>At Acadiana Pest Solutions, we've been treating homes in Duson for years. We understand the local soil conditions, the seasonal pest cycles tied to rice cultivation and crawfish pond management, and the specific structural vulnerabilities of Duson's housing stock &mdash; from older pier-and-beam homes near the railroad tracks to modern slab-on-grade construction in newer subdivisions. Our technicians don't just spray and leave; they investigate, identify, and implement solutions built around what's actually happening in your home and yard.</p>
          <p>Whether you're dealing with a termite swarm in spring, a fire ant mound that appeared overnight after a rain, or mosquitoes making your back porch unusable on summer evenings, we have effective, affordable treatments that work in Duson's unique environment.</p>

          <h2>Common Pests Found in Duson, LA</h2>
          <p>Duson's location between Lafayette and the open agricultural land of western Lafayette Parish creates ideal conditions for a variety of pest species. Here are the pests we treat most frequently in this area:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pest-grid">

          <div class="pest-card">
            <div class="pest-icon">&#127757;</div>
            <h3>Mosquitoes</h3>
            <p>Without question, mosquitoes are the number one pest complaint in Duson. The rice fields, irrigation channels, roadside ditches, and crawfish ponds surrounding the community create virtually limitless mosquito breeding habitat. Standing water accumulates quickly in Duson's flat terrain, and after even a modest rain, populations can explode within 48 to 72 hours. Culex and Aedes species are both common here, and in recent years, concerns about West Nile Virus and other mosquito-borne illnesses have made effective control a genuine health priority for Duson families.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="pest-card">
            <div class="pest-icon">&#127928;</div>
            <h3>Subterranean Termites</h3>
            <p>Formosan subterranean termites &mdash; the most destructive termite species in North America &mdash; are endemic throughout Lafayette Parish, and Duson is no exception. The moist, loamy soils in and around Duson's older neighborhoods provide exactly the conditions these termites prefer. Swarms typically occur in April and May, and homeowners often first notice them around porch lights on warm spring evenings. Left untreated, a Formosan colony can cause catastrophic structural damage within a few years. Many homes on Duson's older streets were built before modern termite prevention practices were standard.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="pest-card">
            <div class="pest-icon">&#128027;</div>
            <h3>Fire Ants</h3>
            <p>Fire ants are a constant challenge in Duson, particularly for homes that back up to open fields or undeveloped land. After heavy rains &mdash; which are common in Louisiana &mdash; fire ant colonies will move their mounds quickly, sometimes appearing overnight in lawns, garden beds, or even on driveways and patios. For families with young children or pets, fire ant mounds are a genuine safety hazard. Duson's mix of residential lots and neighboring agricultural land means ant pressure can be relentless without a professional management program.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="pest-card">
            <div class="pest-icon">&#128001;</div>
            <h3>Rodents (Rats &amp; Mice)</h3>
            <p>Duson's position at the edge of agricultural land makes it prime territory for rodent activity. When fields are harvested or flooded for crawfish, rodents that have been living in those areas are displaced and often move into nearby residential structures. Norway rats and roof rats are both common, and mice can squeeze through gaps as small as a dime. Rodents in Duson tend to enter homes seeking shelter, especially as temperatures drop in November and December, and they can cause serious damage to electrical wiring, insulation, and ductwork.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="pest-card">
            <div class="pest-icon">&#129429;</div>
            <h3>Cockroaches</h3>
            <p>American cockroaches (locally called &quot;palmetto bugs&quot;) and German cockroaches both thrive in Duson's climate. American cockroaches often enter from outside through drains, gaps around utility lines, and under doors; they love the warm, humid conditions under pier-and-beam homes. German cockroaches are more likely to be found in kitchens and bathrooms, and they reproduce rapidly &mdash; a small infestation can become a major problem within weeks. The high humidity in Duson's summers accelerates their breeding cycle significantly.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="pest-card">
            <div class="pest-icon">&#128027;</div>
            <h3>Bed Bugs</h3>
            <p>Bed bug infestations don't discriminate by location &mdash; they travel on luggage, used furniture, and clothing. Duson residents who travel through the nearby I-10 corridor, stay in hotels, or purchase secondhand furniture can bring bed bugs home without knowing it. These pests are notoriously difficult to eliminate without professional heat treatment or targeted chemical application. Early detection is key; bites, small blood stains on sheets, or tiny dark spots on mattress seams are early warning signs that every Duson homeowner should know.</p>

            <blockquote>
              &ldquo;We've lived on our property in Duson for over twenty years and backed up against a rice field, so mosquitoes and fire ants have always been a problem. We tried all kinds of store-bought treatments over the years and nothing really worked for more than a week. A neighbor recommended Acadiana Pest Solutions last summer, and honestly I wish we'd called sooner. The technician who came out actually walked the whole back fence line with me and explained why our yard was such a bad problem area &mdash; the drainage ditch along the property line was basically a mosquito nursery. They treated the yard and showed us some simple things we could do with the ditch. We've had treatments three times now and this summer has been dramatically better. We could actually eat outside on the back porch, which hadn't happened in years. The fire ant program has been great too. Highly recommend them to anyone in Duson or out this way on I-10.&rdquo;

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions &mdash; Pest Control in Duson</h2>
          <p>Questions we commonly hear from Duson homeowners and business owners:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-list">

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
              Why are mosquitoes so much worse in Duson than in Lafayette proper?
              <span class="faq-arrow">&#9660;</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Duson's rural-agricultural setting is the primary reason. Standing water is the key driver of mosquito populations, and the rice fields, irrigation channels, roadside drainage ditches, and crawfish ponds that surround Duson create enormous amounts of mosquito breeding habitat &mdash; far more than you'd typically find in an urban neighborhood. Each female mosquito can lay 100 to 400 eggs per batch, and in warm Louisiana weather, eggs can hatch and larvae can develop into biting adults in as little as 5 to 7 days. When you have thousands of acres of standing water within a mile of residential streets, the mosquito pressure is going to be significantly higher than in more urbanized areas. A professional mosquito control program &mdash; including barrier sprays and larvicide applications in standing water sources on your property &mdash; is really the only way to achieve meaningful reduction.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
              We've noticed more rodents after the fields nearby were harvested. Is that normal in Duson?
              <span class="faq-arrow">&#9660;</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Absolutely, and it's one of the most common pest calls we receive from Duson homeowners each year. When rice fields are harvested in late summer and fall, and when crawfish ponds are pumped down, the rodent populations that had been living in those agricultural areas suddenly lose their shelter and food source. They disperse outward, and nearby residential structures &mdash; especially homes with crawl spaces, attached garages, or gaps around utility penetrations &mdash; are prime targets. Norway rats tend to move in at ground level, while roof rats will climb trees and gain entry through rooflines and eaves. The solution has two parts: eliminating the rodents already present through trapping and baiting, and then sealing every possible entry point to prevent re-entry. We call this process exclusion, and it's the key to long-term rodent control in communities like Duson that border agricultural land.</p>

            <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
              Do I really need professional termite treatment, or can I use store-bought termiticides?
              <span class="faq-arrow">&#9660;</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>For Formosan subterranean termites &mdash; which are the primary termite threat in Duson and throughout south Louisiana &mdash; over-the-counter products are genuinely inadequate. Formosan termite colonies are massive, often containing several million individual termites, and they build extensive mud tube networks in the soil under and around your home. Effective treatment requires either a professional liquid termiticide applied to a continuous trench around the home's foundation (a process called a &quot;soil treatment&quot; or &quot;Termidor treatment&quot;) or the installation of an in-ground bait station system. Both require proper licensing, professional-grade products, and technical knowledge about soil conditions and application rates. We strongly recommend professional treatment for Duson homes &mdash; the cost of treatment is always far less than the cost of repairing termite damage, which typically runs into tens of thousands of dollars when infestations are caught late.</p>
