      <h2>Protecting Carencro Homes from Local Pests</h2>
      <p>Your local Acadiana pest control team, right here when you need us.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="location-intro-content">
      <p>Carencro is one of Lafayette Parish&rsquo;s fastest-growing communities, and with that growth comes an increased need for dependable pest management services. Situated just north of Lafayette along I-49, Carencro is a vibrant city with a rich Cajun heritage, and its residents deserve the same quality pest protection that any major city provides. At Acadiana Pest Solutions, we are proud to serve the Carencro community with the same dedication and expertise we bring to every corner of the Acadiana region.</p>
      <p>The climate in southern Louisiana creates near-perfect conditions for many pest species to thrive year-round. Carencro&rsquo;s mix of residential subdivisions, commercial corridors, and undeveloped wooded land gives insects and rodents abundant harborage and food sources. Wetlands and drainage ditches throughout the area create stagnant water where mosquitoes breed by the millions during warm months, while the warm, humid soil harbors enormous populations of subterranean termites that threaten the structural integrity of homes and businesses alike.</p>
      <p>We have been treating pest problems in Carencro for years and understand the specific pressures this community faces. From the newer subdivisions along Hwy 182 to the established neighborhoods near downtown, we have helped hundreds of Carencro families reclaim their homes and outdoor spaces from unwanted pests. Our team of state-licensed technicians arrives on time, treats your property thoroughly, and follows up to ensure the job is done right.</p>
      <p>Whether you are dealing with a sudden ant invasion, a suspected termite infestation, a rodent problem in your attic, or relentless mosquitoes making your backyard unusable, Acadiana Pest Solutions has a proven treatment program to solve the problem quickly and keep it solved. We use a combination of modern low-impact treatments and time-tested techniques tailored to the specific pest pressures found in Carencro and throughout Lafayette Parish.</p>

<!-- Common Pests in Carencro -->
<section class="section why-section" style="background:#f8f8f8;">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="section-header">
      <h2>Common Pests Found in Carencro, LA</h2>
      <p>Understanding local pest pressures is the first step to effective protection.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="why-grid">
      <div class="why-card reveal">
        <h3>Subterranean Termites</h3>
        <p>Formosan and Eastern subterranean termites are a serious and ongoing threat to every structure in Carencro. Louisiana&rsquo;s warm, moist soil is among the most termite-active environments in the entire country. A mature colony can consume several pounds of wood per day, causing damage that often goes undetected for years behind walls and under flooring. Annual inspections and a reliable termite baiting or liquid treatment program are essential for any Carencro property owner.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="why-card reveal">
        <h3>Mosquitoes</h3>
        <p>Mosquitoes are not just a nuisance &mdash; they are a genuine public health concern in Lafayette Parish. Standing water in ditches, low-lying yards, clogged gutters, and containers around your property all become breeding grounds for Aedes and Culex mosquito species that can carry diseases including West Nile Virus. Carencro&rsquo;s drainage patterns and abundant rainfall from spring through fall keep mosquito populations sky-high without professional intervention.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="why-card reveal">
        <h3>Fire Ants</h3>
        <p>Red imported fire ants are deeply entrenched throughout Carencro&rsquo;s residential lawns, schoolyards, and commercial properties. Their painful stings pose a real risk to children, pets, and anyone who accidentally disturbs a mound. Fire ant colonies can contain hundreds of thousands of workers and multiple queens, making over-the-counter treatments largely ineffective. Professional broadcast treatments and targeted mound baiting provide lasting control.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="why-card reveal">
        <h3>Cockroaches</h3>
        <p>American cockroaches, also commonly called palmetto bugs in south Louisiana, are large and prolific invaders of kitchens, bathrooms, and utility areas throughout Carencro. German cockroaches are a persistent indoor problem in apartments, restaurants, and homes. Both species reproduce rapidly and contaminate food surfaces with bacteria and allergens. Effective cockroach control requires treating harborage areas, applying gel baits, and sealing entry points to prevent reinfestation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="why-card reveal">
        <h3>Rodents</h3>
        <p>Roof rats and Norway rats are active in Carencro, particularly as new construction displaces wildlife from surrounding areas. Rats and mice enter homes through surprisingly small gaps in rooflines, foundations, and utility penetrations. Once inside, they chew electrical wiring (creating fire hazards), contaminate insulation, and spread disease through droppings and urine. Our rodent programs include exclusion work that stops new animals from entering after existing populations are eliminated.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="why-card reveal">
        <h3>Bed Bugs</h3>
        <p>Bed bugs have become increasingly common across all of Acadiana, and Carencro is no exception. These blood-feeding insects hitchhike into homes via used furniture, luggage, and clothing. They hide in mattress seams, behind headboards, inside outlet covers, and in the cracks of bed frames. A bed bug infestation causes significant sleep disruption and anxiety. Our heat treatment and chemical treatment options eliminate bed bugs at all life stages quickly and effectively.</p>

      <h2>Our Commitment to the Carencro Community</h2>
      <p>We are not a national chain &mdash; we are your Acadiana neighbors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="location-intro-content">
      <p>At Acadiana Pest Solutions, we take our role in the Carencro community seriously. As a locally owned and operated business, every customer we serve is a neighbor, and we treat each job with the care and respect that our customers deserve. Unlike large national pest control chains where you may deal with a different technician every visit, we strive to send the same experienced technician to your home so they can build familiarity with your property and its specific pest challenges.</p>
      <p>We stay current with the latest pest control methods and products approved for use in Louisiana. Our technicians are state-licensed through the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and they participate in ongoing training to stay ahead of emerging pest threats and treatment technologies. We carry full general liability insurance and workers&rsquo; compensation coverage, so you can have complete peace of mind when our team is on your property.</p>
      <p>We understand that pest control is not a one-time event but an ongoing commitment. That is why we offer quarterly and bi-monthly general pest control maintenance programs designed to keep your Carencro home protected year-round. Regular preventative treatments stop infestations before they start, saving you money and stress in the long run. Our maintenance customers enjoy priority scheduling and discounted rates on any additional services they may need.</p>
      <p>We are also deeply committed to responsible pesticide use. We select products based on their effectiveness and their profile for safety around children and pets when applied according to label directions. We educate our customers on sanitation practices, moisture control, and structural improvements that reduce pest pressure so that chemical treatments work more effectively and are needed less frequently over time.</p>
      <p>When you call Acadiana Pest Solutions, you speak with a real person who knows Carencro. We can often schedule same-day or next-day appointments, and we provide transparent pricing before any work begins. There are no surprise fees or high-pressure upselling &mdash; just honest, effective pest control from a team that is invested in the health and safety of your home and family.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;We had a massive termite problem that we discovered during a bathroom renovation. Acadiana Pest Solutions came out the very next morning, confirmed the extent of the damage, and got us started on a liquid treatment and monitoring program the same week. Their technician was incredibly thorough and took the time to explain everything. We have been using their quarterly service ever since and have had zero issues.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;The mosquitoes in our backyard were so bad that we could not even use our pool in the evenings. After signing up for the monthly mosquito treatment plan, we noticed a dramatic difference within the first two visits. Our kids are actually outside playing again. The technicians always call ahead and are very professional. Highly recommend to anyone in Carencro dealing with mosquitoes.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Found rodent droppings in my attic after hearing scratching at night. Acadiana Pest Solutions sent someone out quickly, found several entry points around the roofline, set traps, and sealed everything up. Within two weeks the problem was completely resolved. They also followed up with a courtesy call to make sure everything was still good. Great local company that actually cares about their customers.&rdquo;</p>

        <h3>Do I need a termite bond in Carencro?</h3>
        <span class="faq-question__icon">+</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>A termite bond, or termite warranty agreement, is highly recommended for any property in Louisiana, including Carencro. Given the extreme termite pressure in our region, a warranty agreement ensures that your property is inspected regularly and that any retreatment needed due to new termite activity is covered at no additional cost. Many lenders and home buyers require an active termite bond at the time of closing.</p>

        <span class="faq-question__icon">+</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>In Carencro, mosquito season effectively runs from March through October, with peak activity in the summer months. Most customers see the best results with monthly treatments during this period. We also offer bi-monthly service for properties with particularly high mosquito pressure. A single treatment typically provides meaningful relief for three to four weeks depending on rainfall and temperatures.</p>

        <span class="faq-question__icon">+</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>For general pest control, we ask that you clear items away from baseboards in rooms being treated, store food items in sealed containers, and ensure pets are kept in an untreated area during and immediately after service. For termite treatments or rodent exclusion work, we may have additional specific preparation instructions that we will communicate when you schedule your appointment.</p>
