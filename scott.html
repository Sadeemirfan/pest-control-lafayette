            <h2>Your Neighbors in Scott Know Us Best</h2>
            <p>Scott, Louisiana &mdash; proudly known as the <strong>Boudin Capital of the World</strong> &mdash; is a tight-knit community where front porches still matter and neighbors look out for each other. From the busy stretch of Cameron Street lined with beloved boudin shops and family-run businesses, to the quiet residential streets off Ambassador Caffery and the established neighborhoods near I-10, Scott has a character all its own. And like any community in the Acadiana region, it also has its share of unwelcome guests.</p>
            <p>At Acadiana Pest Solutions, we&rsquo;re just a short drive down the road in Lafayette &mdash; close enough to reach you fast, and local enough to understand exactly what pests thrive in Acadiana&rsquo;s humid subtropical climate. Whether you&rsquo;re dealing with fire ants taking over your backyard, subterranean termites working quietly beneath your older home&rsquo;s slab, or rodents sneaking in through gaps near your kitchen, we have the expertise and tools to eliminate the problem and keep it gone.</p>
            <p>We&rsquo;ve served Scott homeowners, restaurant owners, and business operators for years. We understand the unique combination of older housing stock, expanding commercial corridors along Highway 90, and the lush vegetation that makes Scott beautiful but also makes it hospitable to a wide variety of pests year-round.

          <h2>Common Pests in Scott, Louisiana</h2>
          <p class="section-sub">Scott&rsquo;s warm climate, older home construction, and mix of residential and commercial properties create ideal conditions for a variety of pest pressures. Here&rsquo;s what we see most often &mdash; and why.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pests-grid">

          <article class="pest-card">
            <div class="pest-icon">&#128027;</div>
            <h3>Subterranean Termites</h3>
            <p>Scott has a significant number of older homes &mdash; many built in the 1960s through 1980s &mdash; that are prime targets for Formosan and native subterranean termites. These silent destroyers thrive in Acadiana&rsquo;s year-round warmth and moisture. Properties near drainage ditches or low-lying areas near Bayou Courtableau are especially vulnerable. Termite colonies can cause tens of thousands of dollars in structural damage before homeowners ever notice visible signs. Annual inspections are critical in Scott.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="pest-card">
            <div class="pest-icon">&#128028;</div>
            <h3>Red Imported Fire Ants</h3>
            <p>Fire ants are perhaps the most universally despised pest in Scott yards. They&rsquo;re impossible to miss &mdash; those reddish-brown mounds pop up in lawns, garden beds, and even near driveways. What&rsquo;s more concerning is their aggressive swarming behavior when disturbed; a single mound can house hundreds of thousands of workers ready to sting. Scott&rsquo;s open grassy areas and warm soil temperatures make conditions perfect for fire ant colonies to thrive from spring all the way through late fall.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="pest-card">
            <div class="pest-icon">&#128000;</div>
            <h3>Rodents (Rats &amp; Mice)</h3>
            <p>Scott&rsquo;s busy commercial strip along Cameron Street and Highway 90 &mdash; with its restaurants, boudin shops, and grocery stores &mdash; provides abundant food sources that attract Norway rats and roof rats to the surrounding neighborhoods. Rodents follow food trails and can easily move from commercial dumpsters into nearby residential areas. They enter homes through gaps as small as a quarter, contaminate food, chew electrical wiring, and carry dangerous diseases. We see a significant spike in rodent activity during the cooler fall and winter months.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="pest-card">
            <div class="pest-icon">&#129423;</div>
            <h3>American &amp; German Cockroaches</h3>
            <p>Both the large American cockroach (locals call them &ldquo;palmetto bugs&rdquo;) and the smaller, harder-to-eliminate German cockroach are prevalent in Scott. American cockroaches love the moisture-rich environments under sinks, in garages, and around HVAC systems &mdash; all common in older Scott homes. German cockroaches tend to invade kitchens and bathrooms, reproducing rapidly. They can trigger asthma and allergies and contaminate food preparation surfaces. Professional treatment is far more effective than over-the-counter products alone.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="pest-card">
            <div class="pest-icon">&#129748;</div>
            <h3>Mosquitoes</h3>
            <p>Acadiana&rsquo;s subtropical climate means mosquitoes are a near-year-round problem in Scott. Standing water from frequent south Louisiana rains collects in gutters, flower pots, drainage ditches, and low spots in yards, creating perfect breeding grounds. In Scott, mosquitoes aren&rsquo;t just a nuisance &mdash; they are a genuine health concern given the ongoing presence of West Nile Virus and other mosquito-borne illnesses in Louisiana. Our seasonal mosquito treatment programs dramatically reduce populations and let Scott families reclaim their outdoor spaces.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="pest-card">
            <div class="pest-icon">&#127826;</div>
            <h3>Bed Bugs</h3>
            <p>Bed bug infestations are on the rise statewide, and Scott is no exception. These tiny, flat insects are expert hitchhikers that arrive in luggage, secondhand furniture, and clothing. They hide in mattress seams, box springs, headboards, and even electrical outlets. Bed bugs are notoriously difficult to eliminate without professional treatment &mdash; over-the-counter sprays rarely penetrate all hiding spots. If you wake up with itchy, red bites in a line or cluster, call us immediately for an inspection. Early detection makes treatment far more efficient and less costly.</p>

            <p class="testimonial-text">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lived in our Scott home for over 20 years and had a terrible fire ant problem every single spring. I mean, the whole backyard was covered in mounds. I also had what I suspected were termites near my back porch. I called Acadiana Pest Solutions based on a neighbor&rsquo;s recommendation, and I&rsquo;m so glad I did. The technician showed up on time, did a thorough inspection, explained everything clearly, and gave me a treatment plan I could actually afford. Within two weeks, the fire ants were gone and I haven&rsquo;t seen a single mound since. They found active termite activity near my back steps too &mdash; early enough that we avoided major structural damage. These folks actually care about doing the job right. I&rsquo;ve already referred three of my neighbors to them.&rdquo;</p>
