          <h2>Why Mosquitoes Are a Serious Problem in Acadiana</h2>
          <p>Lafayette and the surrounding Acadiana region present some of the most challenging mosquito conditions in the entire United States. Our subtropical climate &mdash; characterized by long, hot summers, mild winters, and extraordinarily high annual rainfall &mdash; creates a near-perfect breeding environment for more than 60 species of mosquitoes found in Louisiana. The combination of standing water in drainage ditches, bayous, marshes, and poorly drained lawns means that mosquito populations can explode within days of a significant rain event. Unlike colder states where mosquito season lasts only a few months, Acadiana residents deal with biting pressure from as early as February through late November, with peak activity running from April through October.</p>
          <p>Beyond the irritation and itching, mosquitoes in our region pose genuine public health risks. Lafayette Parish and neighboring parishes have documented cases of West Nile Virus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), and St. Louis Encephalitis in recent years. Louisiana has historically recorded some of the highest rates of mosquito-borne illness in the nation, and the presence of the Asian tiger mosquito (<em>Aedes albopictus</em>) &mdash; an aggressive daytime biter &mdash; means there is virtually no safe time to be outdoors in an untreated yard. These threats make professional mosquito control not just a comfort measure, but a legitimate investment in your family&#39;s health.</p>

          <h2>Mosquito-Borne Diseases You Need to Know About</h2>
          <p>Understanding the diseases that mosquitoes can transmit in our region underscores why effective control is so critical. West Nile Virus is the most commonly reported mosquito-borne illness in Louisiana. While many infected individuals experience mild flu-like symptoms, approximately 1 in 150 people infected develop a severe neurological illness that can be life-threatening, particularly for older adults and those with compromised immune systems. There is no specific treatment or vaccine for West Nile Virus, making prevention the only reliable defense.</p>
          <p>Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) is rarer but far more deadly. EEE has a fatality rate of approximately 30 percent in humans, and survivors often face lasting neurological damage. The virus is maintained in bird populations and transmitted to humans and horses by several mosquito species found in our region. St. Louis Encephalitis is another viral disease transmitted by <em>Culex</em> mosquitoes that has caused outbreaks in Louisiana. Dog heartworm, while not a human disease, is a serious concern for pet owners throughout Acadiana. The heartworm parasite is transmitted by mosquitoes and can be fatal in dogs if untreated; South Louisiana has some of the highest heartworm infection rates in the country due to our mosquito pressure.</p>
          <p>Although Zika virus transmission by local mosquitoes has been limited in Louisiana compared to some tropical regions, the risk remains a concern particularly for pregnant women. Taking a proactive approach to mosquito management around your property is the single most effective step you can take to reduce your family&#39;s exposure to all of these diseases.</p>

          <h2>Why Acadiana Has Such Severe Mosquito Problems</h2>
          <p>Several geographic and environmental factors combine to make South Louisiana a world-class mosquito habitat. First, our flat topography means that rainwater has nowhere to go quickly. Low-lying yards, street medians, and open lots frequently hold standing water for days after storms, providing abundant breeding sites. Second, the system of bayous, canals, and retention ponds that crisscross the Acadiana region creates permanent water bodies where mosquito larvae can develop year-round. Third, our lush vegetation &mdash; everything from oak canopies to dense ornamental shrubs &mdash; gives adult mosquitoes the cool, shaded resting spots they need to shelter between feeding events.</p>
          <p>The urban heat island effect in Lafayette also plays a role. Warmer temperatures accelerate the mosquito life cycle, allowing larvae to mature into biting adults in as few as 7 to 10 days during peak summer heat. This rapid reproduction means that a small amount of standing water can produce a large number of mosquitoes in a very short time. Neighborhoods with mature tree coverage, which are especially common in older parts of Lafayette, tend to experience heavier mosquito pressure because the shade keeps daytime temperatures cooler and more comfortable for resting mosquitoes. Finally, Acadiana&#39;s proximity to the Gulf Coast means that tropical weather systems routinely bring heavy rainfall that replenishes standing water across the landscape.</p>

          <h2>Our Professional Mosquito Treatment Options</h2>

          <h3>Barrier Spray Treatments</h3>
          <p>Our barrier spray program is the cornerstone of effective mosquito control for most residential and commercial properties in Acadiana. A trained technician applies a residual pyrethroid-based insecticide to the foliage of shrubs, ornamental plants, low-hanging tree branches, and other vegetation around the perimeter of your property. Mosquitoes spend the vast majority of their time resting in shaded vegetation rather than flying, so treating these resting sites kills existing mosquitoes on contact and continues to repel and kill new mosquitoes for up to 21 days after application. Our barrier spray treatments create an invisible shield around your yard that dramatically reduces the biting mosquito population.</p>
          <p>Each barrier spray service is performed by a licensed technician who will assess your specific yard conditions before applying product. We pay careful attention to areas of dense vegetation, the undersides of leaves where mosquitoes prefer to rest, fence lines, and any structures such as gazebos, covered patios, or outdoor furniture that provides shade. We use products that are formulated for use around people and pets once dry, and we will advise you on the brief drying time required before you re-enter treated areas. Most customers notice a dramatic reduction in mosquito activity within 24 to 48 hours of treatment.</p>

          <h3>Larvicide Treatments</h3>
          <p>While barrier sprays address adult mosquitoes, a complete mosquito management program must also target the larval stage. Larvicide treatments are applied directly to standing water sources on or near your property where mosquito larvae are developing. We use Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), a naturally occurring soil bacterium that is toxic to mosquito larvae but harmless to humans, pets, fish, and wildlife. Bti products are available in tablet, granule, and liquid formulations and can be applied to birdbaths, ornamental ponds, rain barrels, clogged gutters, drainage swales, and any other water body where larvae are present.</p>
          <p>For larger water bodies such as retention ponds and drainage canals that are common on commercial and rural properties throughout Acadiana, we can apply methoprene, an insect growth regulator that prevents larvae from developing into biting adults. Combining larvicide with adult barrier spray treatments provides a multi-generational attack on the mosquito population that yields better long-term results than either approach alone. Our technicians will identify all potential breeding sites during their initial inspection and recommend the appropriate larvicide formulation for each one.</p>

          <h3>Automatic Mosquito Misting Systems</h3>
          <p>For homeowners who want the ultimate in mosquito protection with minimal effort, we offer the installation of permanent automatic mosquito misting systems. These systems consist of a series of fine-mist nozzles installed along fence lines, in landscaping, or under eaves around the perimeter of your property, connected to a central reservoir filled with a pyrethrin-based insecticide. A programmable timer triggers automatic misting cycles, typically at dawn and dusk when mosquito activity is highest, releasing a fine mist of insecticide that kills mosquitoes on contact and settles onto vegetation to create a residual barrier.</p>
          <p>Automatic misting systems are particularly popular among Acadiana families who love to entertain outdoors, who have small children or elderly family members who are especially sensitive to mosquito bites, or who own properties near bayous, marshes, or other heavy mosquito sources. Once installed, the system requires only periodic refilling of the insecticide reservoir and occasional inspection of nozzles and tubing. We offer service contracts to handle all maintenance, so you never have to think about it. Our installation team will design a system layout customized to your property size, landscaping configuration, and mosquito pressure level.</p>

          <h2>Seasonal Mosquito Control Programs</h2>
          <p>A single treatment is rarely sufficient to keep mosquitoes under control throughout Acadiana&#39;s long warm season. Our recurring seasonal programs are designed to provide continuous protection from the first warm days of spring through the last mosquito-active weeks of fall. We offer monthly and bi-monthly service plans that include regular barrier spray visits scheduled on a consistent cycle to ensure that residual protection never lapses. Each visit includes a fresh barrier application plus an inspection for new breeding sites and larvicide treatment of any standing water identified on the property.</p>
          <p>Our technicians will contact you before each scheduled visit and work around your schedule. If a heavy rainfall event occurs between scheduled treatments and you notice mosquito activity picking back up, we offer complimentary re-treatment calls for customers on active service plans. This guarantee means you are protected even during the unpredictable weather that is so common in South Louisiana. We also offer a one-time event treatment service for homeowners hosting outdoor parties, weddings, crawfish boils, or other gatherings who want to ensure their guests are comfortable. Contact us at least 48 hours before your event for best results.</p>

          </ul>

          <h2>Tips to Reduce Mosquitoes Around Your Property</h2>
          <p>Professional treatments are most effective when combined with good property management practices that eliminate or reduce breeding sites. Our technicians will walk you through these recommendations during your initial inspection, but here are the most important steps Lafayette-area homeowners can take to reduce mosquito pressure on their own.</p>
          <p><strong>Eliminate standing water:</strong> Walk your property after every rain event and tip out any water that has collected in flowerpots, saucers, buckets, tarps, children&#39;s toys, and any other containers. It takes less than a tablespoon of water for mosquitoes to lay eggs. Change the water in birdbaths at least twice a week. Keep gutters clean and free of debris so water does not pool in them.</p>
          <p><strong>Manage your landscape:</strong> Keep grass cut short and trim back overgrown shrubs and ground cover. Dense, shaded vegetation is prime daytime resting habitat for mosquitoes. Thin out hedges and ornamental plantings along fence lines where possible. If you have low-lying areas of the yard that regularly hold water after rain, consider grading or installing drainage to improve water flow.</p>
          <p><strong>Treat permanent water features:</strong> Ornamental ponds, retention areas, and rain barrels are common breeding sources that homeowners often overlook. Add Bti dunks to these water bodies and consider adding mosquito fish (<em>Gambusia affinis</em>), which are native to Louisiana and actively consume mosquito larvae. Fountains and water features that keep water moving are less hospitable to mosquito larvae than still-water ponds.</p>
          <p><strong>Use personal protection:</strong> During peak mosquito activity periods &mdash; typically dawn and dusk &mdash; wear long-sleeved clothing when outdoors and apply an EPA-registered repellent containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus to exposed skin. Ensure that window and door screens are intact and fit properly to keep mosquitoes out of your home.</p>
          <p><strong>Maintain your pool or hot tub:</strong> Properly chlorinated and circulating swimming pools are not a breeding source, but pools that have been neglected, covered, or allowed to go green can become significant mosquito breeding sites. Keep your pool properly maintained year-round, especially during winter months when it is tempting to let the chemistry slide.</p>

                <p>Yes, when applied by a licensed professional according to label directions. We ask that people and pets remain off treated areas until the product has completely dried, which typically takes 30 to 60 minutes depending on weather conditions. Once dry, the treated areas are safe for children and pets. We also use Bti larvicide products in standing water, which are completely non-toxic to humans, pets, birds, fish, and beneficial insects such as bees.</p>

We also schedule treatments in the early morning before bees become active, and we recommend that customers inform us of any beehives, butterfly gardens, or other pollinator habitats on the property so we can take additional precautions. While no pesticide application is entirely risk-free, our protocols are designed to minimize impact on beneficial insects.</p>
