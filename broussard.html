      <h2>Serving Broussard Homeowners and Businesses</h2>
      <p>Comprehensive pest control tailored to the unique challenges of Broussard, LA.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-block">
      <p>Broussard, Louisiana sits just south of Lafayette along the Vermilion River, and its combination of warm subtropical climate, abundant moisture, and booming new construction makes it one of the most pest-active communities in Acadiana. Whether you live in one of the many established neighborhoods like Broussard Heights or a newly developed subdivision near Ambassador Caffery, pests are a year-round concern that demands professional attention.</p>
      <p>Our team at Acadiana Pest Solutions has been serving Broussard residents and business owners for years. We understand the local pest pressures that come with living in South Louisiana &mdash; from the relentless subterranean termites that thrive in the region's moist, clay-rich soils to the thick mosquito populations that breed in the bayous and drainage ditches that border many Broussard neighborhoods. We have the tools, experience, and local knowledge to handle every situation effectively.</p>
      <p>Broussard's rapid growth is a point of pride for its residents, but that same growth creates ideal conditions for pest infestations. New construction displaces colonies of fire ants, termites, and rodents from their natural habitats, pushing them directly into established homes. Freshly poured concrete slabs and new landscaping attract moisture-seeking pests, and the steady influx of materials to construction sites can introduce bed bugs and cockroaches to previously clean environments. As Broussard grows, protecting your home from these pressures becomes more important than ever.</p>
      <p>We are proud to offer Broussard homeowners and property managers a full suite of pest management services backed by our satisfaction guarantee. When you call Acadiana Pest Solutions, you get a prompt response, a thorough inspection of your property, a customized treatment plan, and follow-up service to ensure the problem stays resolved. Our licensed technicians are trained to use the most effective, family-safe treatment methods available, giving you peace of mind whether you have young children, pets, or guests in your home.</p>

    <div class="section-header">
      <h2>Common Pest Challenges in Broussard, LA</h2>
      <p>Understanding what you are up against is the first step to effective pest control.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="why-grid">
      <div class="why-card reveal">
        <div class="why-card__icon">[Termite]</div>
        <h3>Subterranean Termites</h3>
        <p>Broussard's warm, humid environment and clay-rich soils are ideal breeding grounds for Formosan and Eastern subterranean termites. These destructive insects can silently consume the structural wood of your home for years before visible damage becomes apparent. New construction homes with wood forms left in soil are especially vulnerable. We offer liquid barrier treatments and baiting systems to protect your investment.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="why-card reveal">
        <div class="why-card__icon">[Mosquito]</div>
        <h3>Mosquitoes</h3>
        <p>Broussard's proximity to the Vermilion River, its numerous drainage ditches, retention ponds in newer subdivisions, and seasonal flooding make mosquito pressure intense from March through November. Mosquitoes are not just an annoyance &mdash; they are a genuine public health concern capable of transmitting West Nile virus, Eastern equine encephalitis, and other pathogens. Our barrier spray programs and larvicide treatments dramatically reduce mosquito populations on your property.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="why-card reveal">
        <div class="why-card__icon">[Ant]</div>
        <h3>Fire Ants and Carpenter Ants</h3>
        <p>Red imported fire ants are ubiquitous throughout Broussard, colonizing lawns, parks, playgrounds, and the edges of driveways and sidewalks. Their painful stings are a serious concern for children and pets. Carpenter ants, attracted to moisture-damaged wood, are also common in older parts of Broussard. We treat both species with targeted baiting and contact insecticide programs that eliminate colonies at their source rather than just driving them to a new location on your property.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="why-card reveal">
        <div class="why-card__icon">[Roach]</div>
        <h3>Cockroaches</h3>
        <p>American cockroaches, also known locally as &ldquo;palmetto bugs,&rdquo; are common throughout Broussard, particularly in older homes, restaurants, and commercial kitchens. German cockroaches are a persistent indoor pest that reproduce rapidly and are notoriously difficult to eliminate without professional treatment. Both species contaminate food, trigger allergies, and spread bacteria. Our cockroach control programs combine gel baiting, growth regulators, and exclusion work to eliminate infestations completely.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="why-card reveal">
        <div class="why-card__icon">[Rodent]</div>
        <h3>Rats and Mice</h3>
        <p>As Broussard's new subdivisions push into previously rural land, displaced rodent populations move into attics, crawl spaces, and wall voids of area homes. Roof rats are especially problematic, entering homes through gaps around rooflines, utility penetrations, and HVAC systems. Rodents cause structural damage by gnawing on wiring and insulation, and they contaminate food and spread disease. We provide comprehensive rodent control including trapping, bait stations, and exclusion sealing to keep them out for good.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="why-card reveal">
        <div class="why-card__icon">[Bug]</div>
        <h3>Bed Bugs</h3>
        <p>Bed bugs do not discriminate by neighborhood or home value &mdash; they are an equal-opportunity nuisance that hitchhikes on luggage, furniture, and clothing. Broussard's growing population of hospitality businesses and its connection to the broader Lafayette metro area means bed bug exposure is a real risk. Early detection and professional treatment are essential to stopping an infestation before it spreads. We offer thorough inspections and proven heat and chemical treatment protocols.</p>

      <h2>Why Broussard Residents Choose Acadiana Pest Solutions</h2>
      <p>We are more than just a pest control company &mdash; we are your neighbors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-columns" style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr;gap:2rem;">
      <div>
        <h3>Local Knowledge That Makes a Difference</h3>
        <p>Our technicians live and work in Acadiana. We know the specific termite pressure along the Vermilion corridor, the fire ant hotspots in newer Broussard subdivisions, and the seasonal patterns that drive mosquito populations to peak levels in the spring and fall. That local expertise means faster diagnosis and more effective treatment compared to national chains that apply a one-size-fits-all approach regardless of geography.</p>
        <p>We stay current with Louisiana Department of Agriculture licensing requirements and continuing education so that every treatment we perform meets or exceeds state standards. Our technicians receive ongoing training on the latest pest management techniques, product developments, and integrated pest management (IPM) principles that minimize chemical use while maximizing results.</p>
        <h3>Transparent Pricing, No Surprises</h3>
        <p>We believe in straightforward, honest pricing. Before any work begins, we provide a detailed written estimate explaining exactly what we will do, what products we will use, and what you can expect in terms of results and follow-up visits. We do not use bait-and-switch tactics or charge hidden fees. Our goal is a long-term relationship with every Broussard customer we serve, and that starts with trust.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Family- and Pet-Safe Treatments</h3>
        <p>We understand that your home is where your family lives, plays, and grows. That is why we prioritize treatment methods that are highly effective against pests while being safe for people and pets when applied correctly. We follow all label directions and safety protocols, use targeted application methods to minimize exposure, and will always inform you of any necessary re-entry intervals after treatment. When you have young children, nursing pets, or immunocompromised family members, just let us know and we will tailor our approach accordingly.</p>
        <p>Our satisfaction guarantee means we stand behind every service we provide. If pests return between scheduled visits, we come back at no additional charge. We are committed to keeping your home pest-free throughout the year, not just on the day we treat.</p>
        <h3>Fast, Reliable Scheduling</h3>
        <p>We know that a pest problem cannot wait. That is why we offer same-day and next-day service for most pest issues in Broussard. Our office staff answers the phone Monday through Saturday from 7am to 7pm, and we dispatch technicians promptly so your home gets the attention it needs without long waits. Emergencies like active termite swarms or severe rodent intrusions receive priority scheduling.</p>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes. We use EPA-registered products applied according to strict label guidelines. We will always let you know if there is a re-entry interval after treatment, and we are happy to schedule services around nap times, school schedules, or times when pets are away from the home if needed.

          What is included in a quarterly pest control plan for my Broussard home?
          <span class="faq-question__icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Our quarterly maintenance plans include four scheduled visits per year covering exterior perimeter treatment, interior spot treatment as needed, web removal from eaves, granular fire ant treatment in the lawn, and unlimited callback visits between scheduled services at no additional charge. Plans can be customized to include mosquito service, termite monitoring, or rodent exclusion depending on your property's specific needs.</p>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>For most standard interior treatments, we ask that you remain out of treated areas for 30 to 60 minutes while the product dries, then ventilate the space before re-entering. Larger treatments such as full-structure fumigation for drywood termites require a longer absence, typically two to three days, but this type of treatment is less common in Broussard given the predominance of subterranean termite species. Your technician will give you specific instructions before treatment begins.</p>

In Louisiana, new construction is required to have a pre-construction soil treatment before the concrete slab is poured, but that protection does not last forever &mdash; and it does not protect areas treated after construction. Broussard's soil conditions are highly conducive to subterranean termite activity, and Formosan termites can establish colonies in new homes within a few years of construction. We strongly recommend establishing a termite monitoring and baiting program as soon as you move in to protect your investment from the start.</p>
