      <p>Acadiana Pest Solutions was founded right here in Lafayette, Louisiana with one goal: to provide Acadiana residents and businesses with the kind of thorough, honest, and effective pest control they deserve. We understand that South Louisiana presents unique pest challenges not found anywhere else in the country. The combination of subtropical heat, abundant rainfall, and bayou ecosystems creates ideal conditions for a wide range of destructive pests &mdash; from the notorious Formosan subterranean termite to the countless species of cockroaches, ants, and mosquitoes that thrive in our environment.</p>
      <p>Our team of state-licensed and insured pest control technicians undergoes continuous training to stay current with the latest treatment technologies and EPA-approved methods. We are proud members of the Louisiana Pest Control Association and the National Pest Management Association, and we adhere to the highest industry standards in every job we perform.</p>
      <p>Whether you need a one-time treatment for an active infestation or a year-round protection plan for your home or business, we have a solution that fits your situation and your budget. We serve residential customers in single-family homes, apartments, and condominiums, as well as commercial clients in the food service, hospitality, healthcare, and retail industries.</p>
      <p>Getting started is easy. Simply call <a href="tel:3375550199">(337) 555-0199</a> or fill out our online form to schedule your free, no-obligation inspection.

      <p>Have questions about pest control in Lafayette and Acadiana? We have answers. Here are some of the most common questions our customers ask us.</p>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>We offer same-day service for most pest emergencies throughout Lafayette and the surrounding Acadiana area. When you call before noon on any weekday or Saturday, we do our best to have a certified technician at your property that same afternoon. For urgent situations &mdash; such as active wasp nests, large rodent infestations, or widespread cockroach activity in a commercial kitchen &mdash; we prioritize your call and dispatch our nearest available technician as quickly as possible. You can always reach us at <a href="tel:3375550199">(337) 555-0199</a>.</p>

          Are your pest control treatments safe for children and pets?
          <span class="faq-question__icon" aria-hidden="true">&#9662;</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes. The safety of your family and pets is our top priority. We use only EPA-registered products and apply them according to strict label instructions. In most cases, you and your family can return home within a few hours of treatment. Our technicians will provide you with specific re-entry instructions based on the type of treatment performed and the areas treated. We are always happy to answer any safety questions you have before, during, or after service. We also offer low-impact and organic-based treatment options for families with young children, sensitive individuals, or pets with specific health concerns.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
          How often do I need pest control treatments in South Louisiana?
          <span class="faq-question__icon" aria-hidden="true">&#9662;</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Because of Louisiana&rsquo;s warm, humid climate, pests are active year-round &mdash; unlike in colder parts of the country where pest activity slows significantly in winter. For most homes in the Lafayette area, we recommend quarterly general pest control service (every three months) to maintain effective protection against ants, cockroaches, spiders, and other common household pests. For termite protection, an annual inspection combined with an ongoing baiting or liquid barrier system is standard. Mosquito control treatments are typically applied monthly during the peak season from March through October. We will work with you to design a service schedule that makes sense for your specific pest pressures and property type.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false">
          Do I need to leave my home during pest control treatment?
          <span class="faq-question__icon" aria-hidden="true">&#9662;</span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>It depends on the type of treatment being performed. For standard general pest control applications such as perimeter sprays, crack-and-crevice treatments, and gel baiting, you typically do not need to vacate your home. You may simply want to keep children and pets out of the treated areas until surfaces have dried, which usually takes 30 to 60 minutes. For more intensive treatments such as full-home fumigation or heat treatment for bed bugs, you will need to be out of the home for a longer period, which we will discuss with you in advance. Our technicians always walk you through exactly what to expect before they begin any treatment.</p>

          <p>A little preparation goes a long way in helping us achieve the best results. Before our technician arrives, we recommend clearing clutter from under sinks, behind appliances, and inside closets to allow access to common pest harborage areas. Store all food items in sealed containers and wipe down kitchen counters and stovetops. If you have pets, place food and water bowls out of the way and cover any fish tanks. For rodent treatments, remove any items stored directly on the floor around the perimeter of your garage or attic. For termite and mosquito treatments, we will provide you with specific preparation instructions when you book your appointment. Our goal is to make the process as smooth and minimally disruptive as possible.</p>
